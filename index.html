                    <p>Our internship program(With Stipend) is designed
                        specifically for students and recent graduates seeking
                        practical experience, hands-on training, and exposure to
                        real-world projects. Participants will have the
                        opportunity to earn a <strong>certificate upon
                            completion</strong>, gain valuable insights into
                        their chosen field, and receive a <strong>small stipend

                    <h3>Assignment and 1 month initial internship Period:</h3>
                    <p>To ensure a good fit, we start with an <strong>unpaid
                            assignment</strong>. Afterward, selected candidates
                        will proceed with a <strong>paid 1 month initial
                            internship period</strong>. This allows both you and
                        our team to evaluate how well you align with the role's
                        expectations. The initial 1 month internship period
                        serves as an introduction to our work environment and
                        allows both parties to assess mutual compatibility
                        before proceeding with a longer-term internship
                        agreement. This is a great opportunity to demonstrate
                        your skills and adaptability in a professional
                        setting.At the end of the 1 month internship period, we
                        will conduct an evaluation. Based on this review, we
                        will inform you of our decision regarding a longer-term
                        internship offer.</p>
