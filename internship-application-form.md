title: Internship Program
subtitle: Designed to provide experience, training, and project exposure
---
Our internship program is designed specifically for students and recent graduates seeking practical experience, hands-on training, and exposure to real-world projects. Participants will have the opportunity to earn a **certificate upon completion**, gain valuable insights into their chosen field, and receive a **small stipend as a token of our appreciation** for their contributions.

**Assignment and Trial Period:** To ensure a good fit, we start with an initial **unpaid assignment**. Afterward, selected candidates will proceed with a **paid two-week trial period**. This allows both you and our team to evaluate how well you align with the role's expectations. The trial period serves as an introduction to our work environment and allows both parties to assess mutual compatibility before proceeding with a longer-term internship agreement. During the trial period, you will be introduced to tasks at [https://github.com/orgs/Pragament/projects/40](https://github.com/orgs/Pragament/projects/40). This is a great opportunity to demonstrate your skills and adaptability in a professional setting. At the end of the trial period, we will conduct an evaluation. Based on this review, we will inform you of our decision regarding a longer-term internship offer.

**Letter of Recommendation (LOR):** After successfully completing the internship (minimum 2 months), you will receive an online verifiable Letter of Recommendation (PDF certificate with QR code) and a LinkedIn recommendation from the Pragament company director. The LOR will include the following:
* Rating: Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, or Meets Expectations.
* Evaluation Areas:
   - Quality: Accuracy, thoroughness, and competence.
   - Quantity: Productivity level, time management, and ability to meet deadlines.
   - Job Knowledge: Skills and technical knowledge.
* GitHub Contributions: Your GitHub code contributions chart for public and private repositories within the Pragament organization will be included. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569e25ea-eeeb-426c-b321-971748565358)
