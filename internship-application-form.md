Our internship program(With Stipend) is designed specifically for students and recent graduates seeking practical experience, hands-on training, and exposure to real-world projects. Participants will have the opportunity to earn a **certificate upon completion**, gain valuable insights into their chosen field, and receive a **small stipend as a token of our appreciation** for their contributions.

**Assignment and 1 month initial internship Period:** To ensure a good fit, we start with an **unpaid assignment**. Afterward, selected candidates will proceed with a **paid 1 month initial internship period**. This allows both you and our team to evaluate how well you align with the role's expectations. The initial 1 month internship period serves as an introduction to our work environment and allows both parties to assess mutual compatibility before proceeding with a longer-term internship agreement. This is a great opportunity to demonstrate your skills and adaptability in a professional setting. At the end of the 1 month internship period, we will conduct an evaluation. Based on this review, we will inform you of our decision regarding a longer-term internship offer.

**Letter of Recommendation (LOR):** After successfully completing the internship (minimum 6 tasks), you will receive an online verifiable Letter of Recommendation (PDF certificate with QR code) and a LinkedIn recommendation from the Pragament company director. The LOR will include the following:
* Rating: Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, or Meets Expectations.
* Evaluation Areas:
   - Quality: Accuracy, thoroughness, and competence.
   - Quantity: Productivity level, time management, and ability to meet deadlines.
   - Job Knowledge: Skills and technical knowledge.
* GitHub Contributions: Your GitHub code contributions chart for public and private repositories within the Pragament organization will be included. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569e25ea-eeeb-426c-b321-971748565358)
