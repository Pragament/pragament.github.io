> 🎯 **Don't fall for placement guarantees. Build skills that guarantee your future.**



### Limitations of Paying Lakhs of rupees to Join "Guaranteed Placement" Training Institutes

---

1. **No Real Guarantee**
- The term “guaranteed” is often vague or misleading.
- Read the fine print — many conditions may void the guarantee.

2. **Low-Quality Placements**
- Often results in:
  - Low-paying internships or freelance gigs
  - Roles unrelated to the course (e.g., sales/support)
  - Companies with high attrition or poor culture

3. **Overpriced Compared to Alternatives**
- You can get similar or better learning from:
  - Online platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or YouTube
  - Open-source projects and GitHub contributions
  - Local internships or workshops
- All at a fraction of the cost.

4. **Cookie-Cutter Teaching**
- Focus on rote learning and outdated content
- Mock interviews without real project exposure
- Lack of personalized mentorship or support

5. **Pressure & Hidden Clauses**
- Institutes may:
  - Force you to sign contracts accepting any job offered
  - Refuse refunds if placement conditions aren’t met

6. **Missed Better Opportunities**
- Time spent in these programs could be better used:
  - Building your own portfolio or startup
  - Contributing to open-source
  - Gaining real experience through freelancing or internships

> **Tip:** Invest in learning, not just certificates. Skills + Projects + Networking > Paid Guarantees.
